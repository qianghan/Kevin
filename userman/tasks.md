# User Management System - Implementation Tasks

This document outlines the implementation tasks required to build the User Management System based on the Product Requirements Document (PRD).

## SOLID Principles Implementation

The system follows SOLID principles:
- **S**: Single Responsibility - Each service has a specific responsibility
- **O**: Open/Closed - Extending functionality through interfaces
- **L**: Liskov Substitution - Repository implementations are interchangeable
- **I**: Interface Segregation - Specialized service interfaces
- **D**: Dependency Inversion - Dependency injection for services

## Test-Driven Development Approach (✅ Implementation Complete)

We're implementing a test-driven development (TDD) approach for all features:

### 1. Testing Strategy

- [x] Unit tests for all service methods
- [x] Integration tests for APIs
- [x] BDD test scenarios for key workflows
- [ ] Security and penetration testing
- [ ] Performance and load testing

### 2. Test Implementation for Test Mode (✅ Complete)

Tests have been implemented for the test mode feature:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - UserService.setTestMode
   - UserService.getTestModeUsers
   - UserService.getAllUsers with testMode filter

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Admin API endpoints for test mode
   - Permission checks for test mode access

3. **BDD Tests**:
   - Feature: Test Mode Management
   - Scenarios: Enable/disable test mode, view test mode users

### 3. Test Implementation Process

1. [x] Write the test first
2. [x] Run the test and see it fail
3. [x] Implement the minimal code to make the test pass
4. [x] Refactor the code while keeping tests passing
5. [x] Repeat for next feature

### 4. Test Coverage Goals

- [x] Test coverage for test mode features
- [x] Complete coverage for all user services

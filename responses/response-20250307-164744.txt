### Admission to Computer Science at UBC  

#### Overview  
The University of British Columbia (UBC) offers Computer Science programs through three faculties: **Science (BSc)**, **Arts (BA)**, and **Commerce**. There is **no direct admission** into the Computer Science program. Instead, students must apply to one of these faculties and then specialize in Computer Science.

#### Admission Process  
1. **Faculty Application**:  
   - Apply to one of the three faculties offering Computer Science: **Faculty of Science (BSc)**, **Faculty of Arts (BA)**, or **Faculty of Commerce**.  
   - For the **BSc program**, you must meet the general Science requirements, including specific math prerequisites. Note that IB Math Applications and Interpretations SL or IB Math Studies do not satisfy the math requirement for UBC’s science-based programs.  

2. **Specialization Application**:

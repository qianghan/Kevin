Feature: User Data Migration and Cutover
  As a system administrator
  I want to safely migrate user data to the new system
  So that we can transition without data loss or service disruption

  Scenario: Validate existing user data before migration
    Given there are "100" users in the old system
    When I run the data validation check
    Then I should see a validation report
    And the report should identify any data inconsistencies

  Scenario: Migrate user data to new system
    Given there are validated users in the old system
    When I execute the data migration tool
    Then all user data should be copied to the new system
    And data integrity should be maintained
    And migration progress should be tracked

  Scenario: Clean up inconsistent data during migration
    Given there are users with inconsistent data
    When the migration tool processes these records
    Then the data should be cleaned according to rules
    And cleanup actions should be logged

  Scenario: Notify users about system upgrade
    Given there are active users in the system
    When the migration is scheduled
    Then notification emails should be sent to all users
    And the notification should include maintenance window details
    And the notification should include what to expect

  Scenario: Verify critical user flows post-migration
    Given the migration has been completed
    When I test the critical user flows
    Then all core functionalities should work as expected
    And user sessions should remain active
    And user preferences should be preserved

  Scenario: Monitor system health during cutover
    Given the cutover process has started
    When I check the monitoring dashboard
    Then I should see real-time system metrics
    And I should see migration progress indicators
    And I should see error rates

  Scenario: Execute rollback if needed
    Given the cutover process encounters critical issues
    When I initiate the rollback procedure
    Then the system should revert to the previous state
    And user data should remain intact
    And users should be notified of the rollback

  Scenario: Verify integration with dependent systems
    Given the migration is complete
    When I test integration points with Kevin systems
    Then all system integrations should function correctly
    And data flow between systems should be maintained

  Scenario: Deploy new system with feature flags
    Given the migration is ready for production
    When I deploy the new system
    Then features should be controlled by feature flags
    And gradual rollout should be possible
    And monitoring should show deployment health

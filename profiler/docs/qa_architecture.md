# Q&A System Architecture

## Overview

The Interactive Q&A system is designed to enhance the profiling experience by providing a guided interview process. It generates contextually relevant questions based on the user's profile, processes the answers to extract useful information, and collects feedback to improve the question generation over time.

## Core Components

### QAServiceInterface

This interface defines the contract for the Q&A service. It specifies the following operations:

- `generate_questions`: Generate questions based on a user's profile
- `process_answer`: Process a user's answer to a question
- `generate_followup_questions`: Generate follow-up questions based on previous answers
- `process_feedback`: Process user feedback on a question/answer
- `get_question_history`: Get the history of questions and answers for a profile
- `get_question_analytics`: Get analytics for questions

### QAService

This is the concrete implementation of the QAServiceInterface. It works with a repository to store and retrieve Q&A data.

### Question Generation Workflow

1. The system analyzes the user's profile data
2. It identifies gaps or areas that need more information
3. It generates relevant questions based on those gaps
4. Questions are prioritized based on importance and complexity

### Answer Processing

1. The user provides an answer to a question
2. The system processes the answer to extract key information
3. The profile is updated with the new information
4. Follow-up questions may be generated based on the answer

### Branching Logic

The Q&A system uses branching logic to create a conversational flow:

1. Each question can have multiple follow-up questions
2. The selection of follow-up questions depends on the answer provided
3. This creates a dynamic, personalized interview experience

### Feedback Collection

The system collects feedback on questions to improve over time:

1. Users can provide text feedback on questions
2. Users can rate the quality and relevance of questions
3. This feedback is used to refine the question generation algorithm

## Data Model

### Question
- ID
- Text
- Category
- Follow-up question IDs

### Answer
- Question ID
- Answer text
- Processed flag
- Extracted information

### Feedback
- Question ID
- Feedback text
- Rating

## Integration Points

The Q&A system integrates with:

1. Profile Service - To retrieve and update profile information
2. Document Service - To attach supporting documents to answers
3. Analytics Service - To track question performance and user engagement

## Future Extensions

The architecture is designed to support future enhancements:

1. Integration with AI models for better question generation
2. Support for multimedia answers (images, audio, video)
3. Advanced analytics for question quality assessment
4. Personalized question paths based on user preferences

# Recommendation Personalization Algorithms

This document describes the algorithms and parameters used to personalize recommendations in the Profiler system.

## Algorithm Overview

The recommendation engine employs several specialized algorithms to generate personalized recommendations:

1. **Skill Gap Analysis**: Identifies missing or underdeveloped skills relevant to career goals
2. **Career Path Projection**: Maps optimal steps based on career trajectory and goals
3. **Peer-Based Comparison**: Recommends actions based on successful patterns from similar profiles
4. **Educational Pathway Optimization**: Suggests educational opportunities for career advancement
5. **Profile Completion Engine**: Identifies incomplete or weak areas in user profiles
6. **Temporal Engagement Model**: Determines optimal timing and frequency of recommendations

## Personalization Process

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing

Before applying algorithms, the system:
- Collects user profile data, including skills, education, experience
- Analyzes user interaction history with previous recommendations
- Gathers relevant industry and role benchmarks
- Preprocesses data to normalize formats and scales

### 2. Feature Extraction

Key features extracted include:
- Skill proficiency levels and gaps
- Career trajectory indicators
- Educational achievement metrics
- Engagement patterns with previous recommendations
- Industry-specific requirements

### 3. Algorithm Application

Algorithms are applied in sequence:
1. Primary filtering based on relevance to user profile
2. Scoring based on multiple weighted factors
3. Diversity adjustments to avoid redundancy
4. Final prioritization based on expected impact

### 4. Recommendation Generation

For each selected recommendation opportunity:
- Detailed steps are generated with specific actions
- Expected outcomes are projected
- Time estimates are calculated
- Priority scores are assigned
- Related resources are identified

## Algorithm Tuning

The recommendation engine employs several methods to improve over time:

### A/B Testing

The system regularly tests parameter variations to optimize:
- User engagement with recommendations
- Completion rates
- User-reported satisfaction
- Achievement of stated goals

### Feedback Loop Processing

User feedback is incorporated through:
- Explicit ratings of recommendation value
- Completion rates and abandonment analysis
- Time-to-completion metrics
- Subsequent profile improvements

### Seasonal and Trend Adjustments

Algorithms automatically adjust for:
- Industry trend changes
- Seasonal job market variations
- Educational program timing
- Career path evolution in specific fields

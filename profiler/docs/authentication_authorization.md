# Authentication and Authorization Flows

This document describes the authentication and authorization flows implemented in the Profiler application.

## Authentication Flow

1. **User Registration**
   - Users register with username, email, password, and optional profile information
   - Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storage
   - User accounts are stored in the PostgreSQL database

2. **User Login**
   - Users provide credentials (username/email and password)
   - System validates credentials against stored data
   - On successful validation, a JWT token is generated
   - Token contains user ID and roles with expiration time

3. **Session Management**
   - JWT tokens are validated on each protected request
   - Sessions can be invalidated by blacklisting tokens
   - Automatic token refresh when approaching expiration

## Authorization Flow

1. **Role-Based Access Control**
   - Users are assigned roles (e.g., user, admin)
   - Resources have defined access policies
   - Access decisions are based on user roles and policies

2. **Data Ownership**
   - Users can only access their own profiles and documents
   - Administrators can access all resources
   - Ownership is enforced at repository and service layers

3. **API Security**
   - All API endpoints require authentication
   - Authorization checks are performed before any data access
   - API keys are used for service-to-service communication

## Implementation

The authentication system is implemented using JWT tokens with PostgreSQL for user storage. 
The system follows OWASP security recommendations and implements best practices
for secure authentication and authorization.

## Testing

Comprehensive testing is performed using BDD tests that verify:
- User registration and login flows
- Session management
- Access control mechanisms
- Data ownership enforcement

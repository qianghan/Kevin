# Interactive Q&A Enhancements Implementation

## Overview

The Interactive Q&A Enhancements have been implemented to provide a more engaging and effective profiling experience. The system generates contextually relevant questions based on the user's profile, processes answers to extract useful information, and collects feedback to improve the question generation over time.

## Implemented Features

### Test-Driven Development Setup
- Created BDD tests in `profiler/tests/requirements/prd_4/test_qa_system.py`
- Created feature file with scenarios for question generation, answering, and feedback
- Implemented test fixtures for Q&A data and response formats
- Created mock repositories for Q&A testing
- Implemented test data factory for generating test questions and answers
- Defined acceptance criteria for each Q&A feature

### Design and Architecture
- Designed Q&A service interface (`QAServiceInterface`)
- Implemented interface dependency with profile service
- Designed question generation and answer processing workflow
- Created branching logic framework for follow-up questions
- Implemented feedback collection and processing system
- Designed Q&A history and analytics tracking
- Documented Q&A architecture for future extension

## Architecture Details

The Q&A system follows a clean architecture approach with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Service Layer**: Provides the business logic for question generation, answer processing, and feedback collection.
2. **Repository Layer**: Handles data storage and retrieval for Q&A data.
3. **Domain Model**: Defines the core entities (questions, answers, feedback).

## Key Components

### QAServiceInterface and QAService
The service interface defines the contract for Q&A operations, and the implementation provides the business logic. The service is responsible for:
- Generating relevant questions based on profile data
- Processing answers to extract information
- Creating follow-up questions based on previous answers
- Collecting and processing feedback

### QARepositoryInterface
The repository interface defines the data access contract for Q&A data. It handles:
- Storing and retrieving questions
- Storing and retrieving answers
- Storing and retrieving feedback
- Providing question history and analytics

### Test Infrastructure
The test infrastructure includes:
- BDD feature files defining scenarios
- Test fixtures for providing test data
- Mock repositories for isolated testing
- A data factory for generating test data

## Integration with Existing Systems

The Q&A system integrates with:
1. **Profile Service**: To retrieve and update profile information
2. **Authentication System**: To ensure users can only access their own Q&A data
3. **Analytics Service**: To track question performance and user engagement

## Implementation Approach

The implementation followed a test-driven development approach:
1. Defined acceptance criteria for each feature
2. Created BDD tests that describe the expected behavior
3. Implemented the interfaces and services to satisfy the tests
4. Documented the architecture and design decisions

## Future Extensions

The architecture is designed to support future enhancements:
1. Integration with AI models for better question generation
2. Support for multimedia answers (images, audio, video)
3. Advanced analytics for question quality assessment
4. Personalized question paths based on user preferences

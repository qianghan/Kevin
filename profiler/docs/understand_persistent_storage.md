# Understanding Persistent Storage Implementation

This document outlines the persistent storage architecture implemented for the Profiler application.

## Architecture Overview

The persistent storage system is built using PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy as the ORM layer. The implementation follows 
the repository pattern to separate data access from business logic.

### Key Components

1. **Database Models**
   - Defined using SQLAlchemy ORM
   - Include Profile, Document, User, and related models
   - Implement relationships between entities

2. **Repository Interfaces**
   - Define contracts for data access
   - Allow for swappable implementations
   - Support dependency injection

3. **PostgreSQL Repositories**
   - Implement repository interfaces
   - Handle CRUD operations
   - Manage transactions and error handling

4. **Connection Management**
   - Pooled connections for efficiency
   - Transactional support
   - Error recovery mechanisms

## Data Flow

1. Service layer receives requests from API or WebSocket
2. Repositories are accessed through dependency injection
3. Data is validated before storage
4. Repository operations map to SQL queries
5. Results are transformed back to domain objects

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive tests:
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for repository implementations
- BDD tests for end-to-end scenarios

## Security Considerations

- Connection strings are secured through environment variables
- Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection
- Access control at repository level
- Data validation before storage

## SOLID Principles

The implementation adheres to SOLID principles:
- **S**ingle Responsibility: Each class has one responsibility
- **O**pen/Closed: Systems are open for extension but closed for modification
- **L**iskov Substitution: Implementations can be replaced without affecting clients
- **I**nterface Segregation: Clients only depend on interfaces they use
- **D**ependency Inversion: High-level modules depend on abstractions

## Performance Optimizations

- Connection pooling for efficient database usage
- Optimized queries with indexes
- Batch operations where appropriate
- Lazy loading of related entities

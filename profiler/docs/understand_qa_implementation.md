# Interactive Q&A System Implementation

## Overview

The Interactive Q&A system enhances the profiling experience by providing a guided interview process that collects information from users in an engaging way. The system generates contextually relevant questions based on the user's existing profile, processes the answers to extract useful information, and collects feedback to improve the question generation over time.

## Core Components

### 1. Q&A Service Architecture

- **QAServiceInterface**: Defines the contract for the Q&A service, ensuring all implementations follow the same pattern.
- **QAService**: Base implementation of the interface that handles basic Q&A functionality.
- **EnhancedQAService**: Extended implementation with advanced features like improved question generation, answer quality scoring, multimedia support, and deep information extraction.
- **QAIntegrationService**: Integrates the Q&A system with other services (notifications, document storage, profile updates, analytics, recommendations).

### 2. Data Model

- **Questions**: Contains text, category, importance, follow-up questions, and metadata.
- **Answers**: Stores answer text, quality score, extracted information, and media references.
- **Feedback**: Captures user feedback for questions to improve the system.
- **QASession**: Represents a complete Q&A session with history and analytics.

## Implementations Details

### Question Generation Algorithm

The system generates questions through several methods:

1. **Profile Gap Analysis**: Examines the profile for missing or incomplete information.
2. **Question Bank Selection**: Chooses appropriate templates from the question bank.
3. **Customization**: Personalizes questions based on existing profile data.
4. **Follow-up Generation**: Creates follow-up questions based on answer content.

```python
def generate_questions(self, profile_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Generate questions based on a user's profile."""
    # First try to get questions from the repository
    profile_id = profile_data.get('id')
    stored_questions = self.repository.get_questions_for_profile(profile_id)
    
    # If we have enough questions, return them
    if len(stored_questions) >= 5:
        return stored_questions
    
    # Otherwise, analyze profile to determine which categories need more information
    categories = self._analyze_profile_completion(profile_data)
    
    # Generate questions for each category
    generated_questions = []
    for category in categories:
        bank_questions = self.question_bank.get(category, [])
        for question_template in bank_questions:
            question_text = self._customize_question(question_template["text"], profile_data)
            # Create and save question...
            generated_questions.append(question)
    
    return stored_questions + generated_questions
```

### Answer Processing

Answer processing follows these steps:

1. **Validation**: Ensures the answer meets basic quality standards.
2. **Information Extraction**: Identifies key information in the answer.
3. **Quality Scoring**: Evaluates the answer's quality.
4. **Follow-up Generation**: Creates relevant follow-up questions.

For multimedia answers, additional processing handles the media files and links them to the answer.

### Integration with Profile Service

The system updates user profiles with structured data extracted from Q&A sessions:

```python
async def export_qa_session_to_profile(self, profile_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Export a Q&A session to a profile."""
    # Get the Q&A session
    qa_session = self.qa_service.export_qa_session(profile_id)
    
    # Extract structured information from answers
    structured_data = self._extract_structured_data_from_session(qa_session)
    
    # Update the profile with the structured data
    await self.profile_service.update_profile(
        profile_id=profile_id,
        updates={
            "qa_data": {
                "session_id": str(uuid.uuid4()),
                "exported_at": datetime.now().isoformat(),
                "structured_data": structured_data
            }
        }
    )
    
    # Return success information
    return result
```

## User Interface

The UI components provide a seamless experience:

1. **Question Card**: Displays the current question with category indicator.
2. **Answer Input**: Text area for entering answers with file attachment option.
3. **Progress Indicator**: Shows completion percentage.
4. **Category Tabs**: Allow navigation between question categories.
5. **Feedback Panel**: Collapsible panel for providing feedback.
6. **Navigation Controls**: Buttons to move between questions.

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive testing:

1. **BDD Tests**: Define the behavior of the system.
2. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation.
3. **Integration Tests**: Verify the interactions between components.
4. **Acceptance Tests**: Validate against acceptance criteria.

## Compliance with Acceptance Criteria

### Question Generation

- ✅ Extracts relevant information from answers
- ✅ Updates the profile with information from answers
- ✅ Handles different types of answers (text, multimedia)
- ✅ Validates answers for basic consistency

### Follow-up Questions

- ✅ Generates relevant follow-up questions based on previous answers
- ✅ Supports branching logic for question sequences
- ✅ Links follow-up questions to their parent questions
- ✅ Avoids repetitive or redundant follow-up questions
- ✅ Determines when to end a line of questioning

- ✅ Makes analytics accessible through a well-defined API

## SOLID Principles Compliance

The implementation adheres to SOLID principles:

- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has a single responsibility (QAService for Q&A operations, QAIntegrationService for integration).
- **Open/Closed**: The system is open for extension but closed for modification (can add new question types without changing core logic).
- **Liskov Substitution**: Subtypes (EnhancedQAService) can replace their base types (QAService) without affecting functionality.
- **Interface Segregation**: Interfaces are client-specific (QAServiceInterface, QARepositoryInterface).
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.

## Future Extensions

The architecture is designed to support future enhancements:

1. **AI-Powered Question Generation**: Integrate machine learning for more intelligent questions.
2. **Natural Language Processing**: Enhanced extraction of information from answers.
3. **Advanced Analytics**: More sophisticated analysis of question effectiveness and user engagement.
4. **Conversation Flow Optimization**: Adapting question sequences based on user behavior.
5. **Multimedia Answer Analysis**: Processing images and audio/video content for information extraction.

# Critical Tasks for Chat Interface Implementation

## 1. Service Layer Integration
[] Create adapter layer for chat services to bridge between /ui and /frontend implementations
[] Implement unified chat service factory with strategy pattern
[] Create service proxy for /ui chat functionality
[] Implement shared authentication mechanism for API access
[] Set up unified file upload and attachment service
[] Create service health check and monitoring system

## 2. State Management
[] Implement ChatContext with React Context API that wraps the adapter layer
[] Create state synchronization mechanism between /ui and frontend
[] Implement message handling functionality that maintains compatibility
[] Set up unified event streaming service connection
[] Create session management functionality with backwards compatibility
[] Implement offline support and message queue

## 3. Component Integration
[] Create component mapping layer for gradual transition
[] Implement ChatContainer with theming adaptations for Chakra UI
[] Create ChatHeader with session controls compatible with both systems
[] Implement ChatMessageList with virtualization and consistent rendering
[] Create UserMessage and AIMessage components with shared rendering logic
[] Implement StreamingMessage component with animations
[] Create ThinkingSteps visualization component
[] Implement ChatInput with attachments support

## 4. Session Management
[] Create session data model adapter for cross-application compatibility
[] Implement session list and browser components
[] Create session search functionality with shared indexing
[] Implement session export features with common formats
[] Set up unified storage approach for chat history
[] Create transition tools for migrating existing sessions

## 5. Environment Setup
[] Create unified startup script for all required services
[] Set up containerized development environment
[] Implement backend service initialization
[] Create UI service startup with configurable endpoints
[] Set up frontend service initialization
[] Implement environment variable management
[] Create health check system for all services
[] Set up test data seeding mechanism

## 6. Testing and Validation
[] Create end-to-end test suite for cross-service functionality
[] Implement component compatibility tests
[] Create integration tests for service layer
[] Set up performance testing framework
[] Implement accessibility testing
[] Create cross-browser compatibility tests
[] Set up automated deployment pipeline

## 7. Documentation
[] Create API documentation for chat services
[] Document component compatibility strategy
[] Create session management and migration guide
[] Document service integration architecture
[] Create troubleshooting guide
[] Document deployment process
[] Create user guide for chat interface

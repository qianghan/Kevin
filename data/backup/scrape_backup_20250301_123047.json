The amount of tuition you pay will depend on factors such as your program and year of study, your course load and your campus. While the exact tuition fees for each academic year are typically finalized in the spring, you can take a look at the previous year’s amounts in your area of study to get an idea of how much you’ll pay in tuition. Remember that in addition to tuition, your total fees will include incidental and ancillary fees. Look up Tuition Fees for your area of study. Final tuition, fee schedules, and payment information are posted on the Student Accounts website . Incidental and Ancillary Fees Non-Academic Incidental Fees (or Incidental Fees) contribute to things like student societies, campus-based services, athletics and recreation facilities, and student health and dental plans. Many of these fees are compulsory, but you will have the option of opting out of a small proportion of them. Ancillary fees cover things like field-trip costs, or special equipment provided for coursework, as well as administrative costs such as transcript fees or library fines. Find out more about Incidental & Ancillary Fees. Other Costs of University There are a number of other costs to factor into your budget – for example, the cost of books, educational supplies, food, and residence. And international students should also factor in the University Health Insurance Plan (UHIP). Find more about other costs of attending university. To get a better idea of how much money you will need to cover tuition and fees, housing costs, food and everything else for the upcoming academic year, use our financial planning calculator to budget your costs. This is only a rough estimate on the cost of university, but should give you an idea about how much to budget.

Like the Greater Toronto Area itself, the University is a collection of distinct and diverse communities. Start building your own core community from day one. Within dynamic small-group offerings, you will learn key critical thinking and writing skills, develop intellectual independence, expand your creative side and make a successful transition into university life. One recent graduate took this route in her first year, and found it transformative . “I learned about ideas from disciplines as varied as anthropology, equity studies, philosophy, global health, and Classics, and from classmates whose political view ranged from Marxism to the Tea Party,” says Christine Farquharson. As an aspiring policy analyst, these perspectives helped her develop a nuanced worldview. She went on to complete a double major in Economics and European Studies with a Political Science minor. While that One Program at Victoria College focused on social sciences, you can choose from a variety of these small-group programs offered at each U of T campus, at all seven St. George colleges and at the Munk School of Global Affairs. You can enroll in a One Program even if you aren’t a member of its college. Immerse yourself in the polemics of public policy in the Trinity One program, develop a creative and critical approach to the urban environment with Innis One, tackle real-world global problems at Munk One, or integrate your studies with community service at SMC One (all of these are at St. George). Conduct geological fieldwork or map your own genome sequence in the experiential-learning-focused UTSC One, or examine the role of creative expression in society at utmONE. Take time to find the best fit for you. Innis One: The Creative City Drawing from the College’s three academic programs – Cinema Studies, Urban Studies, and Writing and Develop your creative and critical thinking skills by exploring your urban environment.

Engage in seminars, courses, office hours, volunteer work, summer positions and much more. You might apply for research opportunities like the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada’s Undergraduate Student Research Awards or, in second year, the Research Opportunity Program through the Faculty of Arts and Science or the University of Toronto Mississauga . You could set off to excavate fossil sites in Hungary, examine HIV/AIDS-related issues in Namibia, or develop a painkilling drug analog, without toxic solvents – and you could end up publishing your findings in peer-reviewed journals. You can get hands-on experience through the University of Toronto Scarborough’s Arts and Science Co-op programs , the University of Toronto Mississauga’s experiential learning opportunities , or the St. George campus Faculty of Arts and Science’s International Course Module or Research Excursion Program . You might spend a week in Kosovo researching the diaspora’s impact on economic development, or observing international trade agreement negotiations in Brasilia. Field schools are another option for students in areas such as archeology, anthropology, geology, ecology, environmental science and biology. Fourth-year ecology and evolutionary biology student Danielle de Carle studied the dung beetle in the Peruvian rainforest during a two-week Tropical Field Biology course. Since this course has students trekking into one of the world’s biodiversity hotspots, it’s no surprise they’ve made a novel discovery: a jumping caterpillar. Of course, you don’t need to travel abroad to expand your horizons. You could participate in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology field courses in Algonquin Provincial Park , or local archeological digs. You might develop your own breakthrough right here on campus, just like Qian (Linda) Liu and Kaiyin (Cathy) Zhu . In their fourth year as undergraduates in engineering, they took a project-based Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering course, in which students tackle real-world predicaments. After an anesthesiologist in the community described a need, the students devised a $20 3D-printed tracheal intubation tool, and won awards for its imaginative design. This just scratches the surface. With the University of Toronto’s 12,589 leading faculty members, and over a billion dollars in research funds awarded a year, we offer many different ways to get involved. Whatever your academic interests, you’ll find a variety of opportunities to pursue research – both within the classroom setting, and beyond.

But advancements in emergency trauma care have improved the odds of surviving a shooting. These days about 20% of shootings are fatal. What happens to survivors after the fact? How does getting shot impact their health? And what can we as a society do to better meet the needs of the wounded and their families? This talk will draw from ethnographic work in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which at the time of this research had the highest homicide rate amongst large cities in the United States. I will sketch the struggles that victims and their families endure in the aftermath and show how some of the same lessons can be applied to the Canadian context.

From the Lab to the Village: My Career Path and Life’s Work – Prof. Obidimma Ezezika This U of T Talk was presented by Prof. Obidimma Ezezika, Assistant Professor, Department of Health & Society, U of T Scarborough. Recorded on May 27, 2021. Description: Over the years I have come to realize how often the bridge from the lab to village is broken, and it drives me crazy… Every scientist, engineer, politician, and entrepreneur experiences the “delivery gap” at one time or another. Having knowledge about what works is no guarantee it will reach the people it’s intended for. What is needed is Implementation Science, a methodology that can guide the uptake and adaptation of evidence-based innovations and practices to local constraints. In this talk I describe my journey from the lab to the village, both metaphorically and literally. Why Trust Science? A Philosophical Inquiry into Reasonable Beliefs – Prof. Alexander Koo This U of T Talk was be presented by Prof. Alexander Koo, who is an Assistant Professor, Teaching Stream, in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Toronto Mississauga and in the Faculty of Arts & Science. Recorded on April 20, 2021. Description: Why should we trust science? Some commonly heard reasons are: it’s true, it’s objective, or it follows the scientific method. Philosophers of science have examined these reasons and have argued that all of them are false. Science is, in fact, not true, nor is it objective, nor does it follow the scientific method. Despite this, philosophers still overwhelmingly trust science. But why? In this talk I will argue that there is no tension in rejecting the truth, objectivity, and methodology of science and still maintaining that one ought to trust science. An important payoff to this position is that it robs enemies of science of many of their standard arguments for not trusting science. What Does a Leader REALLY Do? – Prof. Nouman Ashraf This U of T Talk was be presented by Prof. Nouman Ashraf, who is an Assistant Professor, Teaching Stream within the Organizational Behavior area and Director, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion at the Rotman School of Management.

A Metis Engineer’s Journey to use Engineering to give Voice to the Under-Represented Recording Currently Unavailable This U of T Talk was presented by Professor Jason Bazylak, who is a Metis Professional Engineer (Homeland: Duck Lake / Professional Engineers of Ontario ), Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering Dean’s Advisor on Indigenous Initiatives, and Associate Professor Teaching Stream. Prof. Bazylak also runs an award winning first year design course series for engineering students . Description: In honour of National Indigenous Peoples Day in Canada (June 21), Metis Engineer Professor Jason Bazylak spoke about his own personal journey into engineering. About how his path into engineering was driven by a desire to bring Voice to the Indigenous people of Turtle Island and eventually to all peoples whose Voice was not previously heard in the engineering profession. About how the strength of a community is in its inclusion. The great Metis leader, unacknowledged for his important role in the founding Canada, Louis Riel once said, “My people will sleep for one hundred years, but when they awake, it will be the artists who give them their spirit back.” As well, Professor Jason Bazylak believes that it will be the Indigenous scholars, like engineers, who give us our Voice back. Teachers, Stay Tuned. Customize your curriculum with one of our pre-recorded U of T Talks—a great way to prompt discussion at any level.

Guidance for Students Who Have Applied to U of T Making Decisions for Ontario Students U of T will make conditional offers of admission based on available Grade 11 and Grade 12 marks, provided that the OUAC record indicates enrollment in all required Grade 12 courses, including ENG4U. If a Grade 12 mark in a prerequisite subject is not available, we will use the mark in the corresponding Grade 11 course. Accepting an Offer Remind your students to click the Admitted link on their application and follow the prompts to officially accept their offers. Students with offers of admission to Engineering should check their application status through the Engineering Applicant Portal: uoft.me/myportal . Reviewing Terms and Conditions Offers of admission are typically conditional upon a student’s final grades, along with submission of any outstanding documents. To check their conditions, students should go to the “Check Your Application Status” page and then click on their target application. If you or your students have any questions about an offer’s terms or conditions, please contact the admitting faculty or campus directly. Residence Students should log into residence.utoronto.ca and confirm their interest in residence before March 31 to be covered by our first-year residence guarantee. Students admitted to the Faculty of Arts & Science should log back into StarRez and rank their choices.

Enrolling for Courses Most program areas allow students to design their own weekly schedules. Course selection occurs online and begins in July or August. Students will receive specific instructions on how and when to select their courses in the spring. In advance of this, Registrars will hold orientation sessions to clarify processes and misconceptions. Note that first-year Engineering students and students in the International Foundation Program do not choose courses and will be provided, instead, with a readymade class schedule. University Health Insurance UHIP is a mandatory health insurance plan for international students, and helps cover the cost of healthcare services delivered and billed in Canada. Enrolment in UHIP is automatic, with coverage charged directly to each student’s ACORN account balance. Learn more at www.studentlife.utoronto.ca/cie/uhip . Paying Tuition Fees The first fees instalment is normally due at the end of August or start of September.

Students may be required to pay a tuition deposit — this will be indicated on their offer page, along with the deposit deadline.

Planning Ahead U of T’s academic year begins in September and consists of a fall semester (September – December) and a winter semester (January – April), punctuated by some statutory holidays, one study break per semester, and a two-week campus closure during the winter holiday season. Classes and final exams for fall-winter and winter courses conclude by late April. Registered students who plan to take summer courses should be aware that the summer term consists of two “semesters” (May-June, July-August), each of which is paced twice as fast as a normal four-month semester. Advice for Students Who Are Exploring Their Options How We Rank The University of Toronto continues to soar in global university rankings and is consistently ranked first in Canada. Learn more about our rankings. Application Deadlines The university application process starts in the fall of the year before you intend to begin your studies. We encourage students to submit their application, and the appropriate application fee, well in advance of the deadlines. View all important dates and deadlines. Recommended Early Application Date We encourage applicants to apply by November 7 . Applying by our recommended application date ensures that applicants have enough time to complete all of the necessary next steps to be considered in all rounds of admission. Frequently Asked Questions About the Early Application Date Is the November 7 recommended application date new? While the November 7 recommended application date is new for Ontario high school applicants, it is not new to the rest of our applicants. Applicants from outside of Ontario have been encouraged to apply by November 7 for the past few years. What needs to happen by the November recommended application date? We encourage applicants to submit the OUAC Undergraduate application by this date. Students are not required to have marks or supplemental applications completed at this time. Why November? In previous years, we noticed that many Ontario students were applying as soon as they received their PINs—some even applied using the old 105 application to get a head start. The November 7 date allows students to get a head start and gives them ample time to understand what next steps they will need to do. This is especially important for students applying to programs with supplemental applications. Submitting the application earlier gives applicants earlier access to prepare their supplemental applications. It’s important to note that some programs have early recommended dates to submit supplemental information . For example, December 1 for Engineering and December 15 for other programs with supplemental applications What happens if applicants submit the OUAC Applications by November 7? By submitting the OUAC application in November, students get earlier access to the next steps of their applications. They have the opportunity to submit supporting documents early and provide their supplemental applications earlier to the university. We are expecting the first round of decisions to be released in late February. Submitting the OUAC Undergraduate application in November—and submitting supplemental applications and supporting documents in December—enables the admissions committee to review completed files in time for the first round of decisions. What happens if applicants submit the OUAC Application in January? We will review all applications received by the application deadline, so long as all next steps are completed and any required documents have been submitted. If a student waits to submit an application until the final deadline, they may not have enough time to complete all of the next steps in order to be considered in our first round of admissions. Completed applications—with all required documents submitted—are reviewed in each round based on the strength of the applicant’s record. Students don’t have marks in November, what is being considered? This is completely normal. In the first round of decisions, we are looking at whatever results are available at that point (completed grade 11 results, any completed grade 12 courses (either taken in the summer or at any time before their grade 12 year). Additional results (like second semester grade 12 marks) will be reviewed in subsequent rounds, once available. For applicants from an Ontario high school, this would require proof of enrolment in six grade 12 U/M courses, including English. Generally, this information is on the OUAC information we receive. Do programs fill completely in the February round? While some program areas make a large number of offers in the February round, generally our programs do not reach capacity in the first round of admission decisions. We continue to make offers throughout the winter & spring. We admit qualified applicants in each round based on the strength of their academic record and any applicable supporting documentation. Highly subscribed areas of study may have limited capacity in the later rounds of admission.

In advance of this, Registrars will hold orientation sessions to clarify processes and misconceptions. Note that first-year Engineering students and students in the International Foundation Program do not choose courses and will be provided, instead, with a readymade class schedule. University Health Insurance UHIP is a mandatory health insurance plan for international students, and helps cover the cost of healthcare services delivered and billed in Canada. Enrolment in UHIP is automatic, with coverage charged directly to each student’s ACORN account balance. Learn more at www.studentlife.utoronto.ca/cie/uhip . Paying Tuition Fees The first fees instalment is normally due at the end of August or start of September. Each student will receive details during the summer, tailored to their program and, if applicable, courseload. Students may be required to pay a tuition deposit — this will be indicated on their offer page, along with the deposit deadline. Moving In and Getting Settled Students who will be living in residence typically move in over the Labour Day weekend (the first week of September). Incoming students should monitor their email regularly for logistical guidance and other updates from their Dean of Residence. We encourage students who wish to learn more about orientation week, sometimes known as Frosh Week, to visit hello.utoronto.ca . Planning Ahead U of T’s academic year begins in September and consists of a fall semester (September – December) and a winter semester (January – April), punctuated by some statutory holidays, one study break per semester, and a two-week campus closure during the winter holiday season. Classes and final exams for fall-winter and winter courses conclude by late April. Registered students who plan to take summer courses should be aware that the summer term consists of two “semesters” (May-June, July-August), each of which is paced twice as fast as a normal four-month semester.

The amount you’ll pay for these depends on several factors, and will probably vary year-to-year – for example, you’ll spend more if you need to purchase a computer in a given year. When it comes to course textbooks, you might want to consider alternatives like e-books, textbook rentals or used books to help reduce costs. You might want to budget at least $1,000 per year on books, and additional amounts for a computer or other equipment, depending on your preferences and program needs.

For example, if you’re living on campus, your residence and meal-plan or other food costs will make up a large proportion of your University expenses. These might range from approximately $8,000 to $15,000 per academic year, depending on where you decide to live, as well as whether you purchase a meal plan or prepare your own food. If you’re planning to live in rental housing off campus, your rent and food costs could total anywhere from $15,000 and up. For those commuting to the University, transportation costs will be a factor. Look into the cost of public transit, or budget for gas, car insurance and parking if you’ll be driving.

    "page_content": "TUITION FEE LOOKUP TOOL – Planning and Budget Skip to content 2024-25 TUITION FEE SCHEDULES The Tuition Fee Lookup Tool is an informational service for students and potential applicants. The official tuition fee schedules are those approved annually by the Governing Council. While we have made every attempt to ensure that the Tool completely and accurately reflects the approved fees, in the event of any discrepancy, the fee schedules posted in the Governing Council meeting materials will prevail. The Tuition Fee Lookup Tool Primarily provides tuition fees based on the rates for full-time students, with a few noted exceptions. Most undergraduate part-time fees are pro-rated on a per-course basis relative to the full-time rates. Most graduate part-time fees are set at 30% of the annual full-time rates. These fee schedules do not include all of the relevant fees for each of the programs listed. For complete information regarding tuition and other incidental fees, please visit Student Accounts . (Please select dropdown choice below and it will prompt the next selection depending on previous choice.) Campus: Choose here Mississauga Campus Scarborough Campus St. George Campus NOTES: The fee schedules for 2024-25 were approved by Governing Council at its meeting on April 4, 2024.  Fee changes are effective May 1 st of each year. For most programs, full-time undergraduate tuition covers a full-time course load in the Fall/Winter sessions. Undergraduate students taking additional courses in the summer term are charged an additional fee. Most graduate programs have an “annualized” program fee that covers the Fall/Winter/Spring period. The preliminary international student tuition fees for 2025-26 are displayed above for information for planning purposes. They are subject to the Governing Council’s review and approval in Spring 2025. Domestic tuition fees for new programs are subject to Ministry review and approval. Tuition fee increases for continuing students comply with the Provincial Government’s Domestic Tuition Fee Framework, and with the University’s internal Fee Level Commitment for Continuing Students for the normal length of a full-time program. The normal length of program is typically two to four years, with some exceptions for longer doctoral or undergraduate programs that incorporate an extra foundation, co-op, or internship year. Students who exceed the normal length of their program will be charged the same tuition as students in the final year of that program. Graduate master’s program students must pay a minimum degree fee based on the declared full-time length of their program at the time of entry.  Full-time students who accelerate and finish their degree requirements in less time than the declared full-time program length and part-time students who have not paid at least the minimum degree fee are required to pay a balance of degree fee that is assessed prior to graduation as outlined on the School of Graduate Studies’ fees website. Tuition fees for self-funded programs that do not receive operating grant support from the Ontario government and tuition fees for most international students are not subject to provincial fee regulations. Tuition fees for most combined and double degree programs by year of study are based on the fees for the individual degree program involved. The combined degree programs involving Arts & Science, UTM, and UTSC HBA and HBSc programs are restricted to specific combinations of specialist, major, or minor programs. Please refer to the respective divisional academic calendar for further details. For combined, dual or double degree programs that combine undergraduate and graduate programs, fee information can only be accessed by selecting an undergraduate or international fee category value. For dual degree programs with partner institutions, in some year(s) and/or term(s) the tuition fees will be charged by the partner institution. Please refer to those institution’s websites for information.",

If registration for a session is cancelled, the program fee is reversed according to the refund schedule applicable to the student’s program of study (Degree and/or Subject POSt). Course Fees Fees are billed on a course by course basis according to the fee schedule for your Degree Program of Study/Subject Program of Study: If you ADD a course, the course fee is charged immediately, regardless of when the course begins. If you ADD a course and change from part-time studies to full-time studies, part-time incidental fees will be reversed and full-time incidental fee will be billed. The definition of full-time and part-time is not the same for all programs. Check with your registrar’s office if you are unsure of this definition. If you CANCEL a course, the course fee is reversed according to the refund schedule applicable to your program of study (Degree and/or Subject POSt). If you CANCEL a course and change from full-time studies to part-time studies, you remain liable for full-time incidental fees, unless the change affecting your course load is made during the 100% refund period for that course. Fees for Arts & Science Deregulated Programs (Subject POSt) Deregulated fees are billed for: Faculty of Arts & Science : Rotman Commerce, Computer Science, Data Science Bioinformatics & Computational Biology programs.

U of T Scarborough : Commerce, Management, any program leading to a BBA degree, Computer Science Students in full-time programs are assessed a program fee; students in part-time programs are assessed a course fee. In addition to the Subject POSt, attributes of students’ Degree POSts are also considered in the assessment of fees. These attributes include: registration status, year of study, attendance class (full-time or part-time status), credits earned. Students are assessed fees once for each degree program registration. If a student is enrolled in more than one Subject POSt, he/she will be assessed the highest fees applicable to those Subject POSts. The Arts and Science programs on the St. George, Mississauga and Scarborough campuses are considered equal for fees purposes. A student considering a move in registration from one campus to another should discuss the fee implications of such a move with their Registrar. Adding a Subject Post Students are charged Subject POSt fees as soon as they accept enrolment in one of the designated Subject POSts. The normal entry point for these programs is: Arts & Science and University of Toronto Mississauga – the session following the session where the 4th credit is earned. University of Toronto Scarborough – The session following the session where the 4th credit is earned or when a student is designated as being in their second year of study. Students entering the program at a later point will be charged Subject POSt fees retroactively to the session designated as the normal entry point for the program. Students admitted with transfer credit will be charged the program fee immediately if transfer credits of 4 or greater are granted (Arts & Science, U of T Mississauga, U of T Scarborough) or they are admitted to year 2 or higher (U of T Scarborough). If transfer credits are less than 4 credits or the student is admitted to year 1, then the Subject POSt fees will be assessed at the normal entry point for the program. Normal entry point for these programs is the semester after you have earned 4.0 credits or more (this includes transfer credits), usually in Year 2. Once admitted to the program, you will be charged program fees retroactively for any courses completed during your second year of study onwards as described above. Shortly after you first accept your offer to a deregulated program, your fees will be reassessed.  Check ACORN regularly for your revised balance and pay this as soon as possible. If you have any questions and/or concerns about your revised invoice, speak to a Financial Aid Advisor immediately. The tuition rate for deregulated programs is higher.  The fee you pay depends on when you were first admitted to (and registered in) a degree program at U of T Scarborough or the Faculty of Arts and Science. For more information about fees, view your divisional fee schedule. Balance of Degree Fees (For Master’s Degree Programs) If you are enrolled part-time in a Master’s degree program, you may be required to pay additional academic fees in order to match the total minimum fees paid by a full-time student in the same program. In some cases, Balance of Degree fees may also apply to full-time students. These fees are determined by the OISE Registrar’s Office (for OISE graduate students) or the SGS Student Services Office (for students in all other graduate programs). Contact these offices for more information. The Balance of Degree fee is billed just prior to graduation.  Payment deadline for this fee is 3 months after graduation, so if you graduate in: June, the payment deadline is September 30 and the first monthly service charge billing date is October 15. November, the payment deadline is February 28, and the first monthly service charge billing date is March 15.

All fees and charges posted to the ACORN account are payable. Students are responsible for planning sufficient time for payments to reach the University’s bank account and to be recorded in the student’s ACORN account by the payment due date. The transfer of funds from major Canadian financial institutions normally takes three to five business days, however the transfer from Canadian credit unions and financial institutions from outside Canada can take much longer. Paper invoices are not routinely mailed. Students are expected to monitor their account on the ACORN at www.acorn.utoronto.ca until the account balance is fully paid. Non-receipt of an invoice, or failure to monitor the account on ACORN or email correspondence directed to the student’s official University of Toronto email address, does not exempt the student from meeting his/her financial obligations. Students who have left the University will continue to be able to view their financial account balance and history on ACORN. The University considers students to be responsible for all aspects of their registration. If someone else is handling the payment of fees, it is the student’s responsibility to advise that person of all the rules and requirements. View Fee Payment & Service Charge Billing Schedules",

    "page_content": "When & How to Pay Tuition and Fees - University Registrar's Office Skip to main content Search our site: Search When & How to Pay Tuition and Fees When & How to Pay Tuition and Fees Once you have enrolled in your courses for a term, you pay the Minimum Payment indicated ACORN to hold your courses by your division’s due date. Then, you pay the remaining balance by your division’s payment due dates . Once your fees are paid, you are considered a registered student. There are several options for students who are unable to pay their fees by the payment due date. Detailed information is provided in this section. When: Fee payment Deadline/Registration Deadline Your registration deadline is your fee payment deadline. The deadline is determined by your Faculty and/or program. Tuition, incidental and ancillary fees are due by this date, or you must arrange for a payment deferral if you’ll be receiving OSAP or other government funded financial aid (e.g., StudentAid BC). Be sure to plan enough time for your bank to transfer the funds to the University, as this can sometimes take between three to five business days, and even longer for international payments. Find Your Registration Deadline How: Invoices, Payments and Deferrals Invoices Your invoices for fees, residence and meal plans are available online through ACORN . Once you’ve verified your registration deadline and accessed your invoice, you can make a full payment, arrange for partial payments, or request a fee deferral. See ACORN Invoice for more information. Payments Payments must be made through your financial institution, via a bank machine, in-bank, online or by telephone. On-campus payments are not available. Please note that there may be additional fees associated with making payments by credit card. See Making Payments for more information. If making a payment from outside Canada, you can use Convera or Flywire. Be sure to allow enough time for the transfer of funds to be processed. Find more information on the Student Accounts website . Deferrals If you’ve qualified for OSAP or other government funded financial aid, you can apply prior to the fee payment deadline to defer your fee payment online. Residence and meal-plan fees are paid over two installments during the academic year. While these may not be deferred, it’s possible to arrange for partial payments. Partial payments will incur service charges on the unpaid portion. Find out more about registration steps and deadlines , including instructions on paying your fees and requesting a tuition fee deferral . Residence Deposit Payment Options After receiving a residence offer via email, follow the instructions to pay the residence deposit through StarRez by the deadline displayed in your offer to secure your spot in residence. It can take 2-3 business days upon receipt of the payment to record the deposit payment. The residence deposit payment will be applied to the residence fees listed in ACORN . Admission Deposit Payment Options If you have received an offer of admission requiring the payment of a non-refundable deposit by a specified deadline, you can make the payment in ACORN via the MasterCard or VISA credit card payment service: Log into ACORN using your Join ID credentials to make the payment. This payment option includes a convenience fee, which is a fee billed by Moneris (credit card service provider), and is NON-REFUNDABLE , even if you decide not to study at the University of Toronto. The convenience fee is billed directly by Moneris, and is not remitted to the University of Toronto. It can take 2-3 business days for the payment to appear in ACORN . Please ensure you allow for time to the payment to be prior to the deadline provided in your admission offer. The admissions deposit payment will be applied toward tuition fees listed in ACORN .",

University of Toronto | University of Toronto Financial Aid Your Future at the University of Toronto is Within Reach We know that financing a university education is no small undertaking. It may involve a mix of financial resources—from student awards to government grants to part-time employment. It will also involve, most importantly, you. In addition to the financial aid programs below, prospective students and their families may wish to consider resources beyond those offered by the government and institution. These may include RESPs; external awards and scholarships offered by community organizations or companies; financial assistance and loans offered through banks and credit unions; part-time employment income; and contributions from family members. At U of T, our goal is to help students like you bring your dream of a university education within reach. Ontario Financial Aid For Ontario residents, the Ontario Student Assistance Program (OSAP) is a government financial aid program made up of a mix of grants and loans.

    "page_content": "OSAP FAQs - University Registrar's Office Skip to main content Search our site: Search OSAP FAQs OSAP Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Below are some of the most commonly asked questions we receive about OSAP. If your question is not here, please see the FAQs Portal . What is the OSAP Financial Aid Literacy Module? If you’re a full-time student completing your first OSAP application for the 2023-24 school year, you’ll need to complete a short information session presented just before you start your application. The session will help you understand: how OSAP works your roles and responsibilities, if you become an OSAP recipient basic financial information to support you through your postsecondary education (for example, creating a budget, understanding credit and debit) Only full-time students completing their first OSAP application for the 2023-24 school year need to complete this module. If you choose to reapply to OSAP for the 2024-25 school year, you will not be required to complete this module again. I can’t find my program of study listed on the OSAP application. What should I do? You should search for the name of the degree you intend to complete, as opposed to your major. Example: “Bachelor of Arts” instead of “English”. Your application will be processed more quickly if you choose the correct program from the list. For undergraduate students: Search for the name of the College or Faculty you’ll be attending. Examples: New College, Trinity, University, Woodsworth, Mississauga, Scarborough, Engineering. Click on Search for program. You’ll see a list of possible programs. Choose the appropriate program and year of study. Example: Bachelor of Arts and Science will cover most undergraduate programs in Life Sciences, Social Sciences, and Humanities. For graduate students: Search the name of your degree program (e.g., Master of Arts, Master of Science, Master of Teaching, PhD, etc.). Choose the best match for your program. Masters students: In many cases, OSAP funding is provided for the September-April period only. To extend your funding for the May-August term, you must request a Summer OSAP extension. The extension application is available in early March of each year. If you cannot find your program when you get to the end of the list, type in the name of your program in the box under “Can’t find your program?” The next screen will allow you to manually enter your start and end dates. The University will verify your program details after you submit your application and required supporting documentation. If I pay my tuition or fees in advance, will I receive less OSAP funding? No. Payments from your own resources before your OSAP is released will not affect the amount of OSAP funding you qualify for. Since you will have reduced your outstanding fees, less of your OSAP funding will be applied to your account. In other words, more of your OSAP funding will be deposited into your bank account. I rely on OSAP for all of my financial need. How am I going to cover my other expenses like food, rent, etc.? OSAP is an assistance program. You and your family are expected to supplement OSAP funding with your own resources. However, if you still do not have enough to cover your financial needs after your OSAP and other resources have been applied to your fees, the University has programs to assist you. For example, the University of Toronto Advanced Planning for Students (UTAPS) program is the University’s largest need-based support program and covers the financial gap between a student’s actual education costs and the costs recognized by their provincial/territorial government student financial aid program. In other words, UTAPS covers unmet financial need. Through UTAPS, U of T provides non-repayable grants to students to help cover this financial need gap, or unmet need. By completing a financial need application through the Need Navigator tool , you will be considered for UTAPS grants (or for grants available through your division/college/faculty). In addition, after you complete the application on the Need Navigator, reach out to your college, faculty, or academic divisional for Financial Counselling . They can help you determine your budget, and apply for a bursary to help cover costs not met by OSAP or UTAPS. Completing the application on the Need Navigator is an important first step for any bursary, grant and/or need-based award application. If you are experiencing a financial emergency, please contact your faculty, college, or academic division to apply for assistance. Undergraduate students can apply for assistance using the Undergraduate Grant application. Graduate students may seek out emergency funding from the School of Graduate Studies. Why does my Student Account say I owe fees when my OSAP is going to be sent to the U of T to pay my tuition and fees? Because your outstanding fees to the University of Toronto may be greater than the amount of OSAP funding that has been redirected to the University of Toronto. Remember, you are responsible for the payment of your tuition and other fees, even if your OSAP funding doesn’t cover your full account balance. If there are delays in your OSAP funding, service charges may be assessed. Please refer to the Student Accounts website for information about the fee deadlines for your division. Your ACORN invoice shows the current amount owing on your account. Check the OSAP website for your current OSAP status and how much OSAP you may have qualified for. After confirms your full-time enrolment to OSAP, your OSAP funding will be sent to the University of Toronto and applied to your account balance indicated on your Invoice. Once the University of Toronto receives your OSAP funding, your invoice will be updated to reflect the OSAP payments received. It can take a few days for OSAP to send us your payment, so be sure to check your OSAP account carefully for the amounts sent to the school to avoid double payments. I am going on a PEY Co-op – how does this affect my OSAP? Students participating in the Professional Experience Year Co-op program are eligible for interest-free status on their previous OSAP loans. You can submit your Continuation of Interest-Free status (CIFS) application online as early as 15 days before your PEY starts in September. The final deadline to submit a CIFS application is 21 days before your PEY ends in April. CIFS forms received outside of this period will not be accepted. Once you have submitted your CIFS form, The University will confirm your status with OSAP to keep your loans interest-free. To access the CIFS form, log into your account and click on “Apply for interest-free status” on the Application page. In the field asking for your program name, write “Engineering PEY Co-op” or “Arts and Science PEY Coop” (not your academic program). When completing the form, indicate the start date of your study period as September 1, 2024 and end date of your study period as April 30, 2025. The income I reported on my OSAP application has changed. Do I need to let OSAP know? Yes. You must let OSAP know if any of your financial or other information changes. You can check the information on file by checking your Application Summary in your online OSAP account . Write a letter explaining the changes, sign it, and upload it to the “Changes to Your Application” section in the Documents page of your OSAP application. I’m receiving a graduate funding package. Do I need to report my graduate income to OSAP? Graduate Funding Package Yes. As part of your OSAP application you agree to provide income information that is complete and true. Failure to report income to OSAP can result in OSAP overpayments and loss of eligibility in future years. All graduate fellowships must be reported to OSAP as Scholarship or Award funding, including your tuition award. The only exceptions to this are the Ontario Graduate Scholarship (OGS) and the Queen Elizabeth Graduate Scholarship in Science & Technology (QEII-GSST). These two Ontario government awards are reported to OSAP by the University of Toronto so you do not have to report them yourself. The funding available for graduate students varies depending on your department and your program. Check with your graduate department to find out whether your funding is paid out as a stipend or as employment income. Typically funding received through stipends and fellowships is reported on a T4A. This funding should be reported as scholarship income on your OSAP application. Any employment income (reported on a T4) must be reported in the “Other Income” section, if it is over $5,600 per term ($11,200 for two terms, $16,800 for three terms) Please note that if you have a funding package, OSAP funding will not be redirected to cover your tuition and fees, since you have an agreement in place with the University of Toronto to cover your tuition and fees already. I am going on an international exchange. Can I still get OSAP? You can receive OSAP while on exchange, but you must provide some additional documentation. The instructions are available at the Learning Abroad website . How do I request a refund of my ACORN credit balance? Before making a refund request, visit the Student Accounts website for important information. The fastest way to get a refund is to set up direct deposit information on ACORN . Please make sure your mailing address and bank account information is accurate on ACORN . If you have received Full-Time OSAP for the current term , and you have a credit balance in ACORN, you should request a refund through ACORN . When you log into ACORN you should see a link for the OSAP Refund request. If you do not see that link in ACORN you can go directly to the refund request site: ACORN Refund Request . The processing time for ACORN refund requests is around 4-6 weeks. Note: You may not be eligible to receive the full amount of the credit balance refunded to you. If you’ve withdrawn from full-time studies or your OSAP has been re-assessed, the credit balance will be applied to repay the University awards and OSAP overpayments first. You will then be refunded the amount that’s left over, if any. If you have not received full-time OSAP for the current term , please follow the instructions on the Student Accounts website . I want to take this year off from my studies. Do I have to tell OSAP? There is no requirement to inform OSAP if you are taking a break from studies. Students need to reapply for OSAP every year, so if you are taking a term or academic year off, no action is required. However, if you are taking a break of six months or longer, you should be aware that previous OSAP loans will go into repayment. You can find information about the repayment process on the OSAP website and through the National Student Loans Service Centre . If you are financially unable to make your regular monthly payments, you can apply for the Repayment Assistance Plan . If you have already submitted a Full-Time OSAP application for 2024-25, you can cancel it on the OSAP website until funding has been issued. When you log in to the list of your full-time OSAP applications, simply click the “Close application” button.",

Janice Fukakusa is someone who helped us stay the course. When she was Chief Administrative Officer and CFO of the Royal Bank of Canada, the country’s largest financial institution, Fukakusa was one of eight executives responsible for setting the overall strategic direction of RBC. Now, she is the chair of the Canada Infrastructure Bank, a crown corporation that attracts private sector and institutional investment to new revenue-generating infrastructure projects that are in the public interest. Janice graduated from in 1976 with a BA in Political Science from Victoria College before obtaining her MBA from the Schulich School of Business. She joined RBC in 1985 and in 2007 was inducted into Canada’s Most Powerful Women Hall of Fame before retiring in 2017. While at RBC, Janice believed that diversity and inclusion provided an advantage in attracting, developing and retaining top talent while ensuring RBC’s continued growth in Canada and around the world. She once spoke to these qualities: \"Diversity and inclusion is something we want to get right. A diverse workforce is able to create innovative and effective solutions that enable us to better respond to the needs of our increasingly multiethnic, multilingual client base – many of whom are women who today play an important role in financial decision-making. It’s the right thing but also the smart thing to do.\" Fukakusa, who is also a board member of the Princess Margaret Hospital Foundation, said the role her parents played in her upbringing led to her success. “My dad had a strong work ethic, entrepreneurial spirit and a dedication to creating his own success.” Published Nov. 28, 2013 Share this page View Facebook Page Follow On Twitter View LinkedIn Page Share By Email Industry Business Don’t miss out!

Doctor of Science (DSC) 1923 If the phrase “the gift that keeps on giving” can be applied anywhere, it can be applied to Frederick Banting and the medical marvel of insulin. Banting was one of the main discoverers of insulin in 1921. University of Toronto Professor Patricia Brubaker, a diabetic and a diabetes researcher, will be eternally grateful. “If Banting had not come along, I wouldn’t be here today,” she says. Brubaker was instrumental in the push to put Banting’s artifacts on permanent display in the MaRS Centre, which includes the desk — made from an oak tree growing on the U of T campus — he used while doing his research. The MaRS centre was built on the site of the old Toronto General Hospital wing where Banting and his assistant, U of T student Charles Best, first began testing their insulin extracts on humans.   The first person to get the insulin serum was 14-year-old Leonard Thompson, in January, 1922. He made a swift recovery. Banting and John J.R. MacLeod, a U of T professor who gave Banting lab space, his assistant Best and laboratory diabetic dogs, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1923 for their discovery of insulin. Researcher James Collip, who worked with all three men, is credited with the most important technical achievement – the purification of the insulin extract. Banting was elected to the Banting and Best Chair of Medical Research at U of T, also in 1923. He worked on the problems of silicosis, cancer and the mechanisms of drowning and how best to counteract them. He served as a liaison officer between the British and North American medical services during World War Two and while travelling to England in 1941, died in a plane crash over Musgrave Harbour, Newfoundland.

Onley Bachelor of Arts (BA) 1975, Hon. Doctor of Laws (Hon. LLD) 2009 In 1984, David Onley commenced a 22-year career with CityTV as Canada’s first on-air reporter with a visible disability.  He was also an outspoken advocate for disability rights.  As a Host/Producer, Science and Technology Specialist, and Weatherman, he showed that ability outshines disability.  In 2007, he was recognized for his community service and leadership by being selected to become the 28 th Lieutenant Governor of Ontario. While studying at U of T Scarborough, where he received a specialist certificate in political science alongside an Honours BA in 1975, he served as Student Council President, and learned about the intricacies of government. After working in radio, Onley was offered the job as CityTV’s Senior Newscaster in 1984. As a result of having polio as a child, he is partially paralyzed from the waist down. When he first began reporting, cameras would shoot him from the waist up. But, Moses Znaimer, who hired him, insisted that he be shown from the ground up like all other reporters. Breaking down such barriers has made him a role model for people with disabilities. After Onley had written the best-selling book, Shuttle: A Shattering Novel of Disaster in Space , he moved on to become CityTV’s Science and Technology Specialist, and a Newscaster for Cable Pulse 24, at which time he received the call from the Prime Minister inviting him to become the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario. \"We have to be willing to see the ability and not the disability, and in doing so, it becomes possible to change lives for the better.\" As Lieutenant Governor, in his Installation Speech, he said “Accessibility is that which enables people to achieve their full potential. It is inclusion. Accessibility is a human right and accessibility is right.” Onley has observed that there are far too many barriers to employment for people with disabilities based on myths about productivity. “Myths like these, need to disappear,\" he says. Amongst his many projects since being in office, he has brought like-minded employers together who have hired persons with disabilities as excellent investments, and thus have seen greater corporate success. His legacy as Lieutenant Governor has raised public awareness about accessibility, established partnerships between numerous organizations with the same dedication to this cause, and has also focused on those facing more subtle impediments to realizing their potential on account of “Invisible disabilities”, such as mental illness, poverty, and illiteracy. He as well used the profile of his office to highlight the achievements of extraordinary people with disabilities and was Canada’s official state representative at the 2008 Paralympic Games in Beijing.

    "page_content": "Robert Herjavec | University of Toronto Alumni Skip to main content Featured Alumni New College | Faculty of Arts & Science Robert Herjavec Bachelor of Arts (BA) 1984 Robert Herjavec calls himself a “serial entrepreneur.” This designation might sound a little scary, especially given his role on CBC Television’s Dragons’ Den . But Herjavec’s rags-to-riches story is really about a nice guy who worked hard and made it big in the worlds of business and entertainment. When Herjavec graduated from U of T in 1984 with a degree in English Literature from New College, few people expected he would become a high-tech entrepreneur. Yet he was able to parlay his skills as an effective communicator into success in multiple arenas. Herjavec arrived in Canada in 1971 after escaping from the former Yugoslavia. He had only a suitcase, $20 and no understanding of English. But he had ambition. This ambition led him to the University of Toronto and after graduation he built and sold several companies including a computer security company to AT&T and a technology company to Nokia. [pquote copy=\"I loved the University of Toronto. The only regret I have is not spending enough time getting to know the facility and services. I was a little too driven to succeed.\"] And succeed he has. After a short retirement, he launched the Herjavec Group, now acknowledged as Canada’s fastest-growing technology company. Herjavec is best known for his starring roles in the CBC’s Dragons’ Den and the American show Shark Tank. He also wrote a best-selling book, Driven, and is a motor-racing aficionado, an avid golfer and fitness devotee. Given his background, Herjavec has gone out of his way to help young people get their start in business. When his family was in the former Yugoslavia, they lived very hard lives. “I don’t know how you could come from that background and not have empathy for people. I’m not a product just of myself; I’m a product of those who were kind enough to guide me along the way. And that’s a service you owe to others – sometimes it’s in the form of money, sometimes it’s your time, but you have to be a guide for others.” Published Nov. 28, 2013 Share this page View Facebook Page Follow On Twitter View LinkedIn Page Share By Email Industries Business | Law Related Alumni Tom Rodinger Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering | School of Graduate Studies When Tom Rodinger found his mom had trouble replacing burned out light bulbs, he helped build the most energy-efficient bulb ever.

    "page_content": "Mychael Danna | University of Toronto Alumni Skip to main content Featured Alumni Faculty of Music | Ontario Institute of Studies in Education Mychael Danna Bachelor of Music (MUSBC) 1986\r\nBachelor of Education (BED) 1987 From Moneyball to Life of Pi , Mychael Danna has put his composing talents to evocative use in a wide array of acclaimed and popular films. Many of his film scores have been issued as albums. Mychael Danna learned his craft at the Faculty of Music at the University of Toronto. He was the inaugural winner of the Glenn Gould Prize Composition Scholarship in 1985. Yet this Winnipeg native who grew up in Toronto was driven from the outset by an impulse to communicate with a wide public. “I didn’t want to be an Ivory Tower composer,” he confessed to the interviewer Heidi McKenzie in 2010. That conviction led him into an astoundingly productive career in film. Meeting future director and fellow U of T student Atom Egoyan was critical. “We learned about film and film scoring together,” Danna says. He has scored every Egoyan film since Family Viewing in 1987. Curiously, his formal training came in handy for the feature Felicia’s Journey , a rare example of a film with a serial, atonal score. A piano student with concert potential as a teen, Danna lost this prospect through a severe injury. He persevered at the Royal Conservatory of Music, which published some of his piano compositions in their pedagogical books. Danna credits the late Walter Buczynski at the Faculty for having impressed him with the need for a master plan and for every note to have a purpose. It was also at the Faculty that he was exposed to the world music sounds that constitute part of his signature as a composer. Recent Danna credits include Bennett Miller’s Moneyball , Egoyan’s Chloe , Terry Gilliam’s The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (with his brother Jeff) and the 3D feature film by Ang Lee, Life of Pi, for which he won a 2013 Academy Award in the Best Original Score category.  Having moved back to Toronto from Los Angeles, Danna returned to U of T in 2011 as the inaugural Louis Applebaum Distinguished Visitor in Film Composition. Danna has written music for dance as well as film. Might an opera be in the offing? “I still don’t feel as if I’ve written the best thing I can write,” he says. “Not even close.” Published Nov. 28, 2013.

She was a U of T student when she scored the gold medal winning goal at the 2002 Olympic Winter Games in Salt Lake City. Since graduating she has won two more Olympic gold medals. One of Canada’s most decorated athletes, Jayna Hefford has played an integral part in the success of the Canadian National Women’s Hockey Team and Olympic team. It was Hefford’s goal in the final second of the game against the U.S. at the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Games that won the Olympic gold medal for Canada. Since then, she has gone on to win gold at both the 2006 Turin and 2010 Vancouver Olympic Winter Games. While studying physical education at U of T, Hefford also played on the Toronto Lady Blues hockey team. \"The Phys. Ed. Program at U of T is one of the best, I think. The courses were tough and challenging, which made getting my degree here something I’m proud of. I know I had to work hard for it.\" Hefford combined her studies with her hockey career with considerable success. She is a six-time World Champion and was named Top Forward at the 2004 World Championships. She also played an integral part in Team Canada's win at the 2000 World Championships, where she scored two crucial goals in the final game to tie the score and force it into overtime. Hefford is one of only two players in Canadian Women's Hockey history to play over 200 international games and one of only three players to score over 100 international goals.

Engage in seminars, courses, office hours, volunteer work, summer positions and much more. You might apply for research opportunities like the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada’s Undergraduate Student Research Awards or, in second year, the Research Opportunity Program through the Faculty of Arts and Science or the University of Toronto Mississauga . You could set off to excavate fossil sites in Hungary, examine HIV/AIDS-related issues in Namibia, or develop a painkilling drug analog, without toxic solvents – and you could end up publishing your findings in peer-reviewed journals. You can get hands-on experience through the University of Toronto Scarborough’s Arts and Science Co-op programs , the University of Toronto Mississauga’s experiential learning opportunities , or the St. George campus Faculty of Arts and Science’s International Course Module or Research Excursion Program . You might spend a week in Kosovo researching the diaspora’s impact on economic development, or observing international trade agreement negotiations in Brasilia. Field schools are another option for students in areas such as archeology, anthropology, geology, ecology, environmental science and biology. Fourth-year ecology and evolutionary biology student Danielle de Carle studied the dung beetle in the Peruvian rainforest during a two-week Tropical Field Biology course. Since this course has students trekking into one of the world’s biodiversity hotspots, it’s no surprise they’ve made a novel discovery: a jumping caterpillar. Of course, you don’t need to travel abroad to expand your horizons. You could participate in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology field courses in Algonquin Provincial Park , or local archeological digs. You might develop your own breakthrough right here on campus, just like Qian (Linda) Liu and Kaiyin (Cathy) Zhu . In their fourth year as undergraduates in engineering, they took a project-based Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering course, in which students tackle real-world predicaments. After an anesthesiologist in the community described a need, the students devised a $20 3D-printed tracheal intubation tool, and won awards for its imaginative design. This just scratches the surface. With the University of Toronto’s 12,589 leading faculty members, and over a billion dollars in research funds awarded a year, we offer many different ways to get involved. Whatever your academic interests, you’ll find a variety of opportunities to pursue research – both within the classroom setting, and beyond.

    "page_content": "Honours & Awards | VPRI Skip to main content Menu Honours & Awards Share: Copied! On this page: What are research honours and awards? Honours, awards and prizes recognizing significant achievements in research and innovation are awarded by many national and international academies, foundations, scholarly associations, and academic institutions. How can honours and awards help me? Research and innovation honours and awards offer important recognition, career development, and in many cases, funding opportunities for faculty members at all career stages. For academic units, divisions and the University, honours and awards offer a measure of the quality of our scholarship; shape our reputation and influence global rankings; and ultimately contribute to a culture of excellence at the University, enhancing our impact and visibility. What do I need before I can begin? Academic divisions may offer additional information, strategic guidance, and internal processes that faculty members should be aware of before planning nominations. Awards coordinators for each division are listed on the Divisional Honours and Awards Coordinators page. List of Topics President's Impact Award & Academy Honours & Awards Opportunities Divisional Honours & Awards Coordinators Award Nomination Tips & Resources Honours & Awards Recognition Faculty Award Reporting Form Overview Research and innovation honours and awards include distinctions such as Fellowship in the Royal Society of Canada; national and international prizes such as the Killam Prize, Governor General’s Innovation Award, and Canada Gairdner International Award; and prestigious research fellowships such as the Guggenheim Fellowship, NSERC Arthur B. McDonald Fellowship and Sloan Research Fellowship. For most honours and awards, researchers or scholars are nominated by their peers for specific achievements or for career contributions to a field. The resources on these pages support faculty members, staff, and academic administrators interested in identifying recognition opportunities, planning peer or institutional nominations, and learning about past successes and best practices. This section also provides information about the nomination process for the U of T President’s Impact Awards , which are administered by the Division of the Vice-President, Research & Innovation and recognize impactful research by faculty members. For other U of T honours such as University Professors and the Awards of Excellence, see U of T Awards & Funding .

Program of Study: Engineering Sciences Year attended IFP: 2014-2015 What are your goals for the future? I would like to improve teamwork efficiency and people’s communication using technology. The biggest goal in my future is to make a charity organization to help poor people around the world. What is the biggest advantage to studying in the IFP? I am in the IFP engineering and now I feel more confident for my next year. I think that IFP has gave me all the tools I will need to stand out in my program. My teachers are always willing to help me, so I can strengthen the essential skills that I will use for my career at U of T and for the rest of my life. Francisco V. Close Francisco V.

Program of Study: International Relations Year attended IEP: 2017 When I got here, I was amazed by beauty of the campus and the University itself. I chose Toronto because I had heard a lot about how modern and charming the city is. This program showed me how interesting and exiting studying in Canada can be. Our classes were very interesting and engaging. Moving to another city was hard for me, but last summer I saw that University of Toronto is full of friendly people who are always ready to help.

Youth International English Program Close Dominick H. Program of Study: Computer Science Year attended IFP: 2014-2015 What is your favourite spot on campus? My favourite spot on campus is Gerstein Science Information Centre (Gerstein Library). It’s not just a place to study. Part of the building is ancient from the late 19th century, which remains the style of classic; other parts of the building are totally modern: high ceilings, French windows… It is the perfect combination of classic and modern, and I think it is the best spot in UofT. What is the biggest advantage to studying in the IFP? I think the biggest advantage of IFP is that it helps international students to fit in UofT. It’s not only a language program, but also helps students to adapt from their high schools to the study in university: IFP can teach them how to do their first working proposals, first academic essays, or even their first research papers in their life.

International Foundation Program Close Alina A. Program of Study: Rotman Commerce Year attended IEP: 2016 In my life I have been to a few English language camps in different countries. IEP was the last one, but nevertheless, the most valuable one. In my opinion, it has been the best travelling experience so far since I got to meet a lot of wonderful people, actually improved my language skills, and most importantly explored Toronto well enough to fall in love with it. My favorite memory probably is a boat cruise: a beautiful night and a breathtaking view of the city skyline. All in all, I had so much fun during the program that later I decided to apply to University of Toronto. It has been two years now, and I am really happy with the decision I made due to IEP. Alina A.

Fee Payment Guidelines The amount owed is the ACORN Account Balance Up to the end of the Session displayed at the top right-hand corner of your current session (Fall-Winter session) invoice.  If you have paid an academic or residence deposit for the upcoming Summer session, the deposit payment is displayed as an unapplied credit to the upcoming session and is not applied to unpaid Fall-Winter session fees. The University considers you to be responsible for all aspects of your registration including fee payment.  If someone else is handling fee payment, it is your responsibility to advise that person of all rules and requirements. Paper invoices are not routinely mailed.  You are expected to monitor your account on ACORN at www.acorn.utoronto.ca.  Non-receipt of an invoice does not exempt you from meeting your financial obligations. If you were deferred (registered without payment) on the basis of funding, you are responsible for paying for tuition & non-tuition fees not covered by your funding. You are responsible for planning sufficient time for payments to reach the University’s bank account and to be recorded in your ACORN account by the payment and service charge deadlines. Monthly service charge of 1.5% compounded (19.56% per annum) will be billed(recorded) on your ACORN invoice on the 15th of every month until paid in full.  Fee payments must be made by the end of the previous month to allow 5-10 business days for recording the fee payment in ACORN account by the monthly service charge billing date. On the current session invoice, Unpaid Fall Term Fee amount (>$0) = ROSI Account Balance Up to the End of the Session minus Winter Term TUITION Sub-Total amounts minus Winter Term NON-TUITION Sub-Total amounts. An ACORN financial hold will be automatically recorded on your account if full payment for the Fall-Winter session fees has not been recorded in the account by April 30th.  This will block transcript requests, and registration for the next session will be refused. Fall and Winter term fees are billed at the same time, however you have the option to pay Fall and Winter fees separately.  The Fall term balance is not displayed on the ACORN invoice How do I Calculate the Amount of Unpaid Fall Term Fees? Calculate the amount of the unpaid Fall term fees on your Fall-Winter session invoice: Unpaid Fall Term Fee amount = ROSI Account Balance Up to the End of the Session – Winter Term TUITION Sub-Total amounts (listed under TUITION CHARGES) – Winter Term NON-TUITION Sub-Total amounts (listed under NON-TUITION CHARGES) (A) – (B) – (C) Unpaid Fall Term fee amount = $3,573.31 = $14,450.00 (A) – $6,601.50(B) – $652.19(B) – $3,623.00(C) ROSI Account Balance Up to the End of the Session: $ 14,450.00 (A)\r\nTUITION – UTSC Bachelor of Commerce\r\n2023 Winter\r\nProgram fee FT – Domestic                              $  6,601.50\r\n\r\n                               Winter Term Sub-Total  --------------   $  6,601.50 (B)\r\n\r\nIncid.

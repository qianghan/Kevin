What is an Award, Grant, and Scholarship? Award: An award can be a scholarship, fellowship, prize, grant or bursary. Grant: A monetary award based primarily on financial need. Sometimes “grant” and “bursary” are used interchangeably, but “grant” is the more common term used at U of T. Scholarship: A monetary award based on academic excellence alone or in combination with financial need. Thousands of non-repayable awards worth more than $100 million are available annually, based on merit, financial need, or a combination of both. Admission Awards Admission awards are for newly admitted students entering the University of Toronto in year one of their undergraduate studies.

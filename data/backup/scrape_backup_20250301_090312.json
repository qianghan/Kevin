University of Toronto | University of Toronto Financial Aid Your Future at the University of Toronto is Within Reach We know that financing a university education is no small undertaking.

In addition to the financial aid programs below, prospective students and their families may wish to consider resources beyond those offered by the government and institution. These may include RESPs; external awards and scholarships offered by community organizations or companies; financial assistance and loans offered through banks and credit unions; part-time employment income; and contributions from family members. At U of T, our goal is to help students like you bring your dream of a university education within reach. Ontario Financial Aid For Ontario residents, the Ontario Student Assistance Program (OSAP) is a government financial aid program made up of a mix of grants and loans. Once you apply and qualify for OSAP, you’ll be considered automatically for other sources of funding, like the University of Toronto Advance Planning for Students (UTAPS) Program. Financial Aid for Ontario Students Canada Financial Aid If you’re from another Canadian province, territory, or First Nations band, you can apply for aid through your government’s financial aid program or your First Nations band.

Monthly service charge of 1.5% compounded (19.56% per annum) will be billed(recorded) on your ACORN invoice on the 15th of every month until paid in full. Fee payments must be made by the end of the previous month to allow 5-10 business days for recording the fee payment in ACORN account by the monthly service charge billing date. On the current session invoice, Unpaid Fall Term Fee amount (>$0) = ROSI Account Balance Up to the End of the Session minus Winter Term TUITION Sub-Total amounts minus Winter Term NON-TUITION Sub-Total amounts. An ACORN financial hold will be automatically recorded on your account if full payment for the Fall-Winter session fees has not been recorded in the account by April 30th. This will block transcript requests, and registration for the next session will be refused. Fall and Winter term fees are billed at the same time, however you have the option to pay Fall and Winter fees separately. The Fall term balance is not displayed on the ACORN invoice How do I Calculate the Amount of Unpaid Fall Term Fees? Calculate the amount of the unpaid Fall term fees on your Fall-Winter session invoice: Unpaid Fall Term Fee amount = ROSI Account Balance Up to the End of the Session – Winter Term TUITION Sub-Total amounts (listed under TUITION CHARGES) – Winter Term NON-TUITION Sub-Total amounts (listed under NON-TUITION CHARGES) (A) – (B) – (C) Unpaid Fall Term fee amount = $3,573.31 = $14,450.00 (A) – $6,601.50(B) – $652.19(B) – $3,623.00(C) ROSI Account Balance Up to the End of the Session: $ 14,450.00 (A) TUITION – UTSC Bachelor of Commerce 2023 Winter Program fee FT – Domestic $ 6,601.50 Winter Term Sub-Total -------------- $ 6,601.50 (B) Incid.

    "page_content": "University Fees How Much Will University Cost? The amount of tuition you pay will depend on factors such as your program and year of study, your course load and your campus. While the exact tuition fees for each academic year are typically finalized in the spring, you can take a look at the previous year’s amounts in your area of study to get an idea of how much you’ll pay in tuition. Remember that in addition to tuition, your total fees will include incidental and ancillary fees. Look up Tuition Fees for your area of study. Final tuition, fee schedules, and payment information are posted on the Student Accounts website . Incidental and Ancillary Fees Non-Academic Incidental Fees (or Incidental Fees) contribute to things like student societies, campus-based services, athletics and recreation facilities, and student health and dental plans. Many of these fees are compulsory, but you will have the option of opting out of a small proportion of them. Ancillary fees cover things like field-trip costs, or special equipment provided for coursework, as well as administrative costs such as transcript fees or library fines. Find out more about Incidental & Ancillary Fees. Other Costs of University There are a number of other costs to factor into your budget – for example, the cost of books, educational supplies, food, and residence. And international students should also factor in the University Health Insurance Plan (UHIP). Find more about other costs of attending university. To get a better idea of how much money you will need to cover tuition and fees, housing costs, food and everything else for the upcoming academic year, use our financial planning calculator to budget your costs. This is only a rough estimate on the cost of university, but should give you an idea about how much to budget. Find out more about registration steps and deadlines, including instructions on paying your fees and requesting a tuition fee deferral.",

# Frontend Integration Tasks

This document outlines a simplified approach to integrate the `/frontend` and `/ui` directories, allowing them to work together with minimal changes by specializing their focus areas:

- **Frontend Project**: Focus on UI components and presentation layer
- **UI Project**: Focus on services, data management, and business logic

## 1. Project Analysis and Boundary Definition

- [ ] 1.1. Document current responsibilities of each project
- [ ] 1.2. Define clear boundaries between frontend (UI components) and ui (services)
- [ ] 1.3. Identify overlapping functionalities that need resolution
- [ ] 1.4. Create a shared terminology document for both teams
- [ ] 1.5. Document integration points between the two projects

## 2. Shared Configuration Setup

- [ ] 2.1. Create a shared npm package for common types and utilities
- [ ] 2.2. Implement shared environment variable handling
- [ ] 2.3. Configure project ports to avoid conflicts (e.g., frontend on 3000, ui on 3001)
- [ ] 2.4. Set up consistent linting and formatting rules across projects
- [ ] 2.5. Create a unified README explaining the dual-project architecture

## 3. Component Library Standardization

- [ ] 3.1. Decide whether to keep both UI libraries (Chakra in frontend, Radix+Tailwind in ui)
- [ ] 3.2. If keeping both, create a thin compatibility layer for shared styling variables
- [ ] 3.3. Document component usage guidelines for developers
- [ ] 3.4. Create shared theme tokens (colors, spacing, etc.) that both libraries can reference
- [ ] 3.5. Implement common layout components that can be shared

## 4. Service Layer Integration

- [ ] 4.1. Convert ui/src/services into a consumable package for frontend
- [ ] 4.2. Create clean APIs for all services that frontend needs to consume
- [ ] 4.3. Implement service proxying for local development
- [ ] 4.4. Set up proper type sharing between projects
- [ ] 4.5. Create service usage documentation

## 5. Authentication and State Sharing

- [ ] 5.1. Implement shared authentication mechanism
- [ ] 5.2. Create a minimal shared state layer for critical application state
- [ ] 5.3. Use localStorage or sessionStorage for cross-app communication where needed
- [ ] 5.4. Document authentication flow between projects
- [ ] 5.5. Create logout mechanism that works across both applications

## 6. API Integration

- [ ] 6.1. Centralize API client code in the ui project
- [ ] 6.2. Create proxy service in frontend to access ui's API clients
- [ ] 6.3. Document API usage patterns for frontend developers
- [ ] 6.4. Implement error handling strategy across both projects
- [ ] 6.5. Create shared API response types

## 7. Routing Integration

- [ ] 7.1. Define URL namespace strategy to avoid conflicts
- [ ] 7.2. Implement cross-application navigation
- [ ] 7.3. Set up deep linking between applications
- [ ] 7.4. Document routing and navigation patterns
- [ ] 7.5. Create shared navigation components

## 8. Development Workflow

- [ ] 8.1. Create unified development startup script
- [ ] 8.2. Configure hot reloading to work with both projects
- [ ] 8.3. Set up shared test runners where needed
- [ ] 8.4. Create integration testing approach for cross-project functionality
- [ ] 8.5. Document development workflow

## 9. Deployment Strategy

- [ ] 9.1. Create a deployment pipeline that builds both projects
- [ ] 9.2. Configure proxying in production environment
- [ ] 9.3. Document deployment process
- [ ] 9.4. Create rollback strategy
- [ ] 9.5. Set up monitoring for both applications

## 10. Documentation and Training

- [ ] 10.1. Create a clear developer guide explaining the two-project architecture
- [ ] 10.2. Document when to use frontend vs. ui for new features
- [ ] 10.3. Create architectural diagrams showing project relationships
- [ ] 10.4. Hold knowledge sharing sessions on the dual-project approach
- [ ] 10.5. Create troubleshooting guide for common integration issues

## 11. Layout and Navigation Integration (Task 5 Re-implementation)

- [ ] 11.1.4. Implement adapter pattern for responsive containers to work with both UI libraries
- [ ] 11.1.5. Create shared hooks for responsive behavior (`useBreakpoint`, `useResponsiveValue`)
- [ ] 11.1.6. Set up integration tests to ensure consistent responsive behavior
- [ ] 11.1.7. Document new integrated responsive system with examples from both projects

### 11.2 Left Navigation Panel Integration
- [ ] 11.2.1. Create shared navigation data structure to be consumed by both projects

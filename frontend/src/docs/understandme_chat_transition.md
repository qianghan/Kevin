## Overview

The KAI application is transitioning from its legacy implementation in the `/ui` directory to a modern Next.js-based frontend architecture. This document focuses specifically on the chat components transition strategy, ensuring a smooth migration without disrupting the user experience.

## Transition Goals

- **Zero-Downtime Migration**: Users should experience no service interruptions during the transition.
- **Feature Parity**: Ensure all existing chat functionalities are available in the new implementation.
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Introduce new features gradually without breaking existing functionality.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Validate all transition scenarios through automated tests before deployment.
- **Clear Metrics**: Define success criteria and monitor performance throughout the transition.

## Component Compatibility Layer

### Adapter Pattern Implementation

We've implemented an adapter pattern to bridge the gap between legacy and new chat components:

```typescript
// Example of adapter implementation for chat input component
export const ChatInputAdapter: React.FC<LegacyChatInputProps> = (legacyProps) => {
  // Transform legacy props to new format
  const newProps: SimpleChatInputProps = {
    value: legacyProps.inputValue,
    onChange: legacyProps.onInputChange,
    onSubmit: legacyProps.onSendMessage,
    attachments: legacyProps.attachments.map(transformAttachment),
    isDisabled: legacyProps.disabled,
    placeholder: legacyProps.placeholder || "Type your message...",
  };
  
  return <SimpleChatInput {...newProps} />;
};
```

### Shared Interface Hierarchy

To maintain compatibility, we've created a hierarchy of interfaces:

1. **Base Interfaces**: Core props shared across all versions
2. **Legacy Extension Interfaces**: Props specific to the legacy implementation
3. **New Implementation Interfaces**: Props for the modern components

This allows for type-safe transitions and clear migration paths:

```typescript
// Base interface shared across implementations
interface BaseChatMessageProps {
  id: string;
  content: string;
  timestamp: Date;
}

// Legacy extension
interface LegacyChatMessageProps extends BaseChatMessageProps {
  legacyFormatting?: boolean;
  // Other legacy-specific props
}

// New implementation
interface NewChatMessageProps extends BaseChatMessageProps {
  reactions?: MessageReaction[];
  // Other new features
}
```

### Fallback Components

For components not yet migrated, we provide fallback mechanisms to ensure uninterrupted functionality:

```typescript
const ChatFeature: React.FC<ChatFeatureProps> = (props) => {
  const { isNewImplementationEnabled } = useFeatureFlags();
  
  if (isNewImplementationEnabled) {
    return <NewChatFeature {...props} />;
  }
  
  return <LegacyChatFeature {...(props as LegacyChatFeatureProps)} />;
};
```

## Feature Flag System

We've implemented a robust feature flag system to control the rollout of new chat components:

### Flag Structure

```typescript
interface ChatFeatureFlags {
  enableNewChatInput: boolean;
  enableNewMessageList: boolean;
  enableNewChatHeader: boolean;
  enableNewAttachmentSystem: boolean;
  enableNewThinkingSteps: boolean;
  // Additional flags as needed
}
```

### Flag Management Service

The Feature Flag Service provides methods for reading, updating, and subscribing to flag changes:

```typescript
interface IFeatureFlagService {
  getFlags(): Promise<ChatFeatureFlags>;
  updateFlag(key: keyof ChatFeatureFlags, value: boolean): Promise<void>;
  subscribeToFlagChanges(callback: (flags: ChatFeatureFlags) => void): () => void;
}
```

### Configuration Sources

Flags can be configured from multiple sources with the following precedence:
1. User preferences (stored locally)
2. Remote configuration (from API)
3. Environment defaults

## Progressive Feature Activation

### Granular Component Migration

Each chat component will be migrated independently, allowing for targeted testing and rollback if needed:

1. Chat input
2. Message display
3. Message actions
4. Attachments
5. Thinking steps
6. Session management

### User-Controlled Activation

Power users can opt-in to new features through the settings panel:

```typescript
const ChatSettings: React.FC = () => {
  const { flags, updateFlag } = useFeatureFlags();
  
  return (
    <SettingsPanel>
      <SettingToggle
        label="Use new chat input"
        isChecked={flags.enableNewChatInput}
        onChange={(value) => updateFlag('enableNewChatInput', value)}
      />
      {/* Additional toggles */}
    </SettingsPanel>
  );
};
```

### Phased Rollout Strategy

The transition will follow a phased approach:

1. **Alpha Phase**: Internal testing with developer flags
2. **Beta Phase**: Limited user testing with opt-in capability
3. **Staged Rollout**: Percentage-based rollout to increasing user segments
4. **Full Deployment**: Complete transition with legacy components maintained as fallbacks

## Testing Strategy

### BDD Test Scenarios

We've implemented BDD tests to validate all transition scenarios:

```gherkin
Feature: Chat Component Transition

Scenario: User sends message with legacy input when new input is disabled
  Given the user has the new chat input feature flag disabled
  When the user types a message in the chat input
  And the user submits the message
  Then the message should be sent successfully
  And the message should appear in the chat history

Scenario: User sends message with new input when feature is enabled
  Given the user has the new chat input feature flag enabled
  When the user types a message in the chat input
  And the user submits the message
  Then the message should be sent successfully
  And the message should appear in the chat history
  And the new message format should be used
```

### A/B Testing Framework

We've implemented an A/B testing framework to measure performance metrics between legacy and new implementations:

```typescript
interface PerformanceMetrics {
  renderTime: number;
  interactionDelay: number;
  memoryUsage: number;
  networkPayloadSize: number;
}

class ChatPerformanceMonitor {
  trackMetrics(component: 'legacy' | 'new', metrics: PerformanceMetrics): void {
    // Send metrics to analytics service
  }
  
  compareResults(): Promise<ComparisonReport> {
    // Generate comparison between implementations
  }
}
```

### Compatibility Test Suite

All chat components undergo compatibility testing ensuring:

1. Visual consistency
2. Functional equivalence
3. Performance benchmarking
4. Accessibility compliance

## Transition Timeline

### Phase 1: Preparation (Completed)
- Interface definition
- Component adapters implementation
- Feature flag system setup

### Phase 2: Alpha Testing (Current)
- Internal developer testing
- Performance benchmarking
- Bug fixes and optimizations

### Phase 3: Beta Release (Week 6-8)
- Limited user testing
- Feedback collection
- Final optimizations

### Phase 4: Staged Rollout (Week 9-12)
- 10% user rollout with analytics
- Gradual increase to 50%
- Monitor for issues

### Phase 5: Full Deployment (Week 13-16)
- 100% rollout of new components
- Legacy components maintained for fallback
- Continued monitoring

### Phase 6: Legacy Deprecation (Week 20+)
- Announce deprecation timeline
- Remove legacy components
- Complete documentation update

## Rollback Procedures

### Monitoring Triggers

We've established automatic monitoring that triggers alerts when:
- Error rates exceed 2% for new components
- Performance degrades by more than 20%
- User-reported issues increase significantly

### Rollback Process

In case issues are detected:

1. Disable affected feature flags programmatically
2. Revert to legacy components
3. Notify development team
4. Analyze logs and error reports
5. Fix and retest before attempting redeployment

### Data Integrity

All chat data is stored in a format compatible with both legacy and new components, ensuring rollbacks don't impact data integrity.

```typescript
// Example of format-agnostic data structure
interface ChatMessageData {
  id: string;
  content: string;
  timestamp: string;
  metadata: Record<string, unknown>; // Extensible for both implementations
}
```

## Conclusion

This transition strategy enables a controlled, measured migration from legacy chat components to the new frontend architecture. By implementing feature flags, comprehensive testing, and monitoring, we ensure a smooth transition with minimal disruption to users.

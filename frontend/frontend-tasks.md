## Implementation Details

The frontend implementation includes:

1. **Next.js Framework** - The application uses Next.js with TypeScript for a robust frontend foundation
2. **Chakra UI Components** - Custom branded components built on top of Chakra UI
3. **React Context API** - Used for state management across the application
4. **SOLID Architecture** - Component and service architecture following SOLID principles
5. **API Integration** - API client layer for communicating with backend services
6. **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first responsive design approach
7. **Testing Framework** - Jest and Cucumber for test-driven development
8. **Chat Components** - Full implementation of chat interface components

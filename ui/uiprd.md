### 9. Architectural Principles

#### SOLID Architecture
The UI implementation will strictly adhere to SOLID principles:

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
  - Each component will have a single responsibility and reason to change
  - UI components will be focused on presentation only
  - Business logic will be isolated to services
  - State management will be handled separately from rendering

- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
  - Components will be open for extension but closed for modification
  - Use of higher-order components and composition patterns
  - Theme extensions without modifying core components
  - Feature flags for enabling/disabling functionality

- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
  - Component interfaces will be well-defined to allow substitution
  - Proper typing of props and state
  - Consistent error handling across component hierarchies
  - Clear component contracts for predictable behavior

- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
  - Component APIs will be minimal and focused
  - Props interfaces will not force unused dependencies
  - Hooks will have single, specific purposes
  - Context providers will be specific to domains

- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
  - Components will depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
  - Service interfaces will be clearly defined
  - Dependency injection for service access
  - Mock service implementations for testing

#### Service Layer Abstraction

- **Clear Service Boundaries**
  - Each service will have a well-defined interface
  - Services will expose only necessary functionality
  - Implementation details will be hidden behind interfaces
  - Domain-specific language for service APIs

- **Service Communication Pattern**
  - Services will interact through well-defined contracts
  - Event-based communication between decoupled services
  - Consistent error handling across service boundaries
  - Standardized response formats

- **State Management**
  - Centralized state management with clear access patterns
  - Service-specific state isolation
  - Predictable state updates
  - Optimistic UI updates with rollback capabilities

#### Agent Service Extensibility

- **Plugin Architecture for Agents**
  - KAI Agent marketplace built on extensible plugin system

  - Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

#### Service Decoupling Strategy

- **Independent Deployment**
  - Services can be deployed independently
  - Feature toggles for partial deployments
  - Backward compatibility guarantees
  - Progressive enhancement strategy

- **Data Isolation**
  - Each service manages its own data
  - Clear data ownership boundaries
  - Cross-service data access through defined APIs only
  - Data synchronization through events

- **Testing Strategy**
  - Services testable in isolation
  - Mock implementations for dependencies
  - Integration testing harness
  - End-to-end testing across service boundaries

# Authentication UI Documentation

This document outlines the authentication UI components for the Kevin application. The authentication system is built on top of the user management service architecture and provides a comprehensive set of UI components for handling user authentication.

## Architecture Overview

The authentication UI is built around the following key components:

1. **AuthContext** - A React context that provides authentication state and methods to components
2. **useAuth Hook** - A custom hook for accessing the authentication context
3. **AuthProvider** - A component that wraps the application and provides the authentication context
4. **Authentication Components** - Form components for login, registration, password reset, etc.

### Authentication Flow

![Authentication Flow](../images/auth-flow.png)

1. User interacts with authentication UI components (login, register, etc.)
2. Components use the `useAuth` hook to access authentication methods 
3. The hook calls methods on the underlying user service obtained from `UserServiceFactory`
4. User service communicates with the backend API
5. Auth state is updated in the context and propagated to components

## Key Components

### AuthContext and useAuth Hook

The authentication context is provided by `AuthContext` and accessed through the `useAuth` hook. This provides:

- Current user information
- Authentication state (loading, error, etc.)
- Authentication methods (login, register, logout, etc.)

```typescript
// Example usage of useAuth hook
import { useAuth } from '@/hooks/useAuth';

function MyComponent() {
  const { user, isAuthenticated, login, logout } = useAuth();
  
  // Use authentication state and methods
}
```

### AuthProvider

The `AuthProvider` component wraps the application and provides the authentication context to all child components. It uses the `useAuthState` hook to maintain state and initialize authentication.

```tsx
// Root layout with AuthProvider
export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <AuthProvider>
          {children}
        </AuthProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### Authentication Components

#### LoginForm

A form component for user login with:
- Email and password inputs
- Remember me option
- Error handling
- Loading state

#### RegistrationForm

A form component for user registration with:
- Required user information fields
- Role selection
- Password strength validation
- Form validation

#### PasswordResetForm

A form component for requesting password resets with:
- Email input
- Success state display
- Error handling

#### PasswordStrength

A component for visualizing password strength that:
- Displays a strength indicator
- Provides feedback on password quality
- Updates in real-time as the user types

## Integration with User Management Services

The authentication UI uses the `UserServiceFactory` to obtain user service implementations. This allows:

1. Seamless integration with different backend implementations
2. Easy switching between real and mock implementations for testing
3. Consistent error handling and caching through the proxy layer

## State Management

Authentication state is managed through React hooks and context:

- `useState` for component-level state
- `useContext` for application-level state
- `useCallback` for memoizing functions
- `useEffect` for side effects like initialization

## Error Handling

Error handling is provided at multiple levels:

1. Component-level validation errors (e.g., password mismatch)
2. Service-level error handling and normalization
3. User-friendly error messages in the UI

## Security Considerations

The authentication UI implements several security best practices:

- Password strength validation
- CSRF protection through tokens
- Automatic session refresh
- Secure password reset flow

## Testing

Authentication components are tested through:

- BDD tests for user flows
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests with mock services

## Usage Examples

### Login Flow

```tsx
import { LoginForm } from '@/components/auth/LoginForm';

function LoginPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Login</h1>
      <LoginForm callbackUrl="/dashboard" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Registration Flow

```tsx
import { RegistrationForm } from '@/components/auth/RegistrationForm';

function RegisterPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Create an Account</h1>
      <RegistrationForm callbackUrl="/verify-email" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Password Reset Flow

```tsx
import { PasswordResetForm } from '@/components/auth/PasswordResetForm';

function ForgotPasswordPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Forgot Password</h1>
      <PasswordResetForm />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Future Enhancements

Future enhancements planned for the authentication UI include:

1. Multi-factor authentication support
2. OAuth integration with social providers
3. Enhanced security features (IP verification, device tracking)
4. Progressive enrollment for user information
5. Account recovery options
